#See if this is good
#pyspark is a directory
#There are some files underneath such as rdd.py
#import pyspark

#question is can ou ever import directories?
#or does it have to be a file?
#For example pyspark is just a directory

#By definition an import executes a file
# There is nothing in the directory that is executed
# So by conclusion what is imported has to be a file!!!
# 
#import import-test
#import importtest
##import sys
#from pyspark import sql

#print (sql.__file__)
##help(sql)
#help(sys)

#print (sys.__file__)

#test
